		<h3>What is a chatbot? </h3>
		<p>A chatbot is a piece of software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner

		<h3>Chatbot and Applications </h3>
		<p>At the heart of chatbot technology lies natural language processing or NLP, the same technology that forms the basis of the voice recognition systems used by virtual assistants such as Google Now, Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana.</p>

		<h3>How a Chatbot works? </h3>
		<p>The ability to identify the user’s intent and extract data and relevant entities contained in the user’s request is the first condition and the most relevant step at the core of a chatbot: If you are not able to correctly understand the user’s request, you won’t be able to provide the correct answer.
Returning the response: once the user’s intent has been identified, the chatbot must provide the most appropriate response for the user’s request. The answer may be:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> A generic and predefined text</li>
	<li> A text retrieved from a knowledge base that contains different answers</li>
	<li> A contextualized piece of information based on data the user has provided</li>
	<li> Data stored in enterprise systems</li>
	<li> The result of an action that the chatbot performed by interacting with one or more backend application</li>
	<li> A disambiguating question that helps the chatbot to correctly understand the user’s request</li>
	</ul>
